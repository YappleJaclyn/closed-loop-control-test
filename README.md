# Closed Loop Control Example

## Description

Use for testing closed loop control

### Topics Covered

* Configuring a SPARK motor controller
* Position closed loop control with PID
* Velocity closed loop control with PID
* Closed loop slots
* Retrieving encoder data
* Resetting encoder position

## Usage

This example assumes a SPARK MAX with a CIM.

Deploy the program to your roboRIO and use ascope to change the following values:

* A toggle to switch between position and velocity control modes
* Input sliders to set target position or velocity
* Output sliders to show actual position and velocity
* A reset button for the encoder position
